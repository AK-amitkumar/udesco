downloaded community odoo from source (couldn't clone bad wifi, had to download from https://github.com/odoo/odoo)
========
downloaded postgres

https://www.odoo.com/documentation/10.0/setup/install.html#setup-install-source

had to do some stuff...

========

failed to install pgadmin :(

==========
back to https://www.odoo.com/documentation/10.0/setup/install.html#setup-install-source

made a postgres user of my linux name 'aiden'



djoodo/

    pulse/ (django app installed with django-admin)

    odoo10/


made venv in odoo folder, pip install requirements.txt, installed ones that didn't work


$ python odoo-bin 

opened odoo in the browser and installed a few important apps

=========

making connection between openerp and django
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goh6swXRYns
https://www.odoo.com/documentation/9.0/api_integration.html


before trying to go django--> odoo10 with xmlrpclib, i will try to make a simple script to create a product_product in odoo

file is in 

djoodo/

    xmlrpx_example.py


==========
setting up pycharm

open the 'djoodo' as my project

'edit-configurations'

for odoo ... python runner with Script: odoo-bin , Working Directory: /home/aiden/djoodo/odoo10

but I need it to run with the odoo virtualenvironment

so File - Settings - Project:djoodoo - Project Interpreter - create virtualenv 'odoo-venv'

create it in /home/aiden/djoodo/odoo10

go into command terminal and install requirements in that new virtualenv and delete my old one...
aiden@aiden-home:~/djoodo/odoo10$ source odoo-venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

===========




=======
django superuser is aiden w pass pulse123
this is also the username and password for the django 'pulse' db (see django settings file)
odoo user is odoo w password odoo (this is what is needed for the xmlrpc)

====
you can only specify one port on postgres conf - but you can have different listen-addresses

so you could make postgres.conf file like this
iron-aiden@ironaiden-X550LD:/etc/postgresql/9.5/main$ sudo nano postgresql.conf
---
listen_addresses = '127.0.0.1,SOME-OTHER-IP'              # what IP address(es) t$
                                        # comma-separated list of addresses;
                                        # defaults to 'localhost'; use '*' for $
                                        # (change requires restart)
port = 5432   


----
where 127.0.0.1 will be openerp and odoo
and 192.168.0.1 will be django
==============

xmlrpc is from django to odoo - but you can Read from odoo AND you can write to odoo database
so it is effectively both ways

IS THRE ANY CASE WHERE SOMTHING MIGHT HAPPEN IN erp THAT WE WOULD NEED TO HAVE UPDATED IMMEDIATELY IN DJANGO?

I DON'T THINK SO... I THINK THE ERP SHOULD MAINLY BE LIKE ACCOUNTING (NOT THE HEART - BUT THE STOMACH -  EVERYTHING INTO IT) 


===========

celery as a scheduler

rabbitmq is the 'broker' used by celery

sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server


=============

monthly invoice with odoo - forget the 'rental' module
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4dzLNNLoEs

search for 'recurring documents' module in apps
there is a module already in codebase, install it

logout/login

turn on developer mode (settings>developer mode) to get full settings menu
settings>Technical>Automation>Recurring Types (here you define invoice as a rcurring type)
